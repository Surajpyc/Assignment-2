# README: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

This Python script calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

## Python Code

```python
n = 0

for i in range(1, 51):
    n = n + i

print("The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is:", n)
```

## Explanation

1. The variable `n` is initialized to 0.  
2. A `for` loop iterates over the numbers from 1 to 50.  
3. In each iteration, the current value of `i` is added to `n`.  
4. After the loop finishes, the total sum is printed.

**Output:**  
```
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
